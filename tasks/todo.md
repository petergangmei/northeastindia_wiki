# Article Form Categorization Section Improvement

## Objective
Improve the user experience and visual design of the categorization section in the article edit form, making it more intuitive and user-friendly while maintaining the existing functionality.

## Analysis of Current Issues

### Identified Problems:
1. **Multi-select boxes are difficult to use**: Current select boxes are cramped and hard to navigate
2. **Poor visual feedback**: Selected items don't show clearly enough
3. **Limited usability**: No search or filter functionality for long lists
4. **Layout issues**: The three-column layout could be better optimized
5. **Mobile responsiveness**: May not work well on smaller screens

## Review Section

### Changes Made
1. **Updated CSS for Section Headings**: Modified `.card-header.bg-light` and `.card-header.bg-primary` rules in `main.css:199` and `main.css:222`
   - Changed `font-weight: bold` to `font-weight: normal !important`
   - Reduced `font-size` from `14px` to `12px`
   - Added specific h3 targeting rules for both `.card-header.bg-light h3` and `.card-header.bg-primary h3`
   - This affects section headings like "Today's Featured Article", "Recent Contributors", "How to Contribute"

### Files Modified
- `/Users/petergangmei/Developer/Crossplatform/django/northeastindia_wiki/static/css/main.css` (lines 199, 227, 210, 238)

### Impact
- Section headings now appear with lighter font weight (normal instead of bold)
- Section headings now have smaller text size (12px instead of 14px)
- Added `!important` declarations to ensure styles override any conflicting CSS
- Maintains Wikipedia-style design consistency with more subtle section headers
