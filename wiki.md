Below is a bird’s-eye view of the layers Wikipedia stacks on top of its “anyone can edit” ideal so that only reliable versions end up in front of most readers. I’ve grouped the moving parts roughly in the order an edit encounters them as it travels from someone’s keyboard to the public article.

1. Open editing & permanent revision history
Every article lives in a public revision log; when you press Save the change is written immediately and can always be rolled back by any editor with one click. This “immutable ledger” means Wikipedia can be bold in letting newcomers try things because every action is reversible.

2. User-rights ladder (“trust but verify”)
Rights tier	How you get it	What it unlocks	Typical purpose
Anonymous / new	none	Can still edit most pages; edits to some pages go into pending review	Lower barrier to contribution
Autoconfirmed	4 days + 10 edits	Move pages, edit semi-protected pages	Basic safeguard against drive-by vandalism
Extended-confirmed (30 / 500)	30 days + 500 edits	Edit “30/500-protected” hot-button topics	Keeps high-profile pages stable
Reviewer / New-page reviewer	Community request	Mark pending edits or new pages as “reviewed”	Front-line quality gate
Administrator	Community election (RfA)	Delete pages, protect pages, block users	Hard power to enforce consensus

3. Drafts & Articles for Creation (AfC)—gatekeeping new pages
Unregistered or brand-new users can’t publish directly to the main encyclopedia; they’re channelled into a Draft: namespace. Volunteer AfC reviewers check notability, sourcing, copyright, etc., and either accept, comment, or decline the draft. Only accepted drafts are moved to “mainspace.”

Parallel to this, every brand-new page that does reach mainspace is flagged in the New Page Patrol feed, where trained reviewers quickly tag or delete spammy or unsourced pages.

4. Abuse filters, bots & machine learning
Abuse-filter rules can automatically block obvious spam before it’s saved.

ClueBot NG and similar ML-based bots scan every edit and revert vandalism within seconds (over 5 million reverts to date).

ORES (Objective Revision Evaluation Service) scores each edit for “damage” and each article for quality; tools like Huggle or Rater surface those scores so humans review where it matters most.

5. Human patrols (always-on community watch)
Recent Changes Patrol—volunteers monitor the live firehose for suspicious edits. 
Wikipedia

Watchlists—editors follow pages they care about and get instant alerts.

Counter-Vandalism Unit coordinates advanced tools and block escalation. 
Wikipedia

6. Page-level protection & revision gating
Mechanism	What it does	Typical use case
Semi-protection	Blocks unregistered/new users	Popular pages hit by drive-by vandalism
Pending Changes	Edits by unregistered/autoconfirmed users stay hidden until a reviewer clicks “accept.”	Controversial BLPs, breaking-news topics
Extended-confirmed (30/500) protection	Only 30/500 users can edit	Israel-Palestine, US politics, etc.
Flagged Revisions (German, Czech, etc.)	Public sees only the last sighted (approved) version; edits are visible instantly only to logged-in users	Whole-site quality baseline
Full/Template protection	Only admins (or template editors) can edit	Critical interface templates, legal issues

7. Deletion workflow—cleaning up what slips through
Speedy deletion for crystal-clear violations (copyright, blatant spam). 
Wikipedia

Proposed deletion (PROD) gives a 7-day grace period if nobody objects. 
Wikipedia

Articles for Deletion (AfD) is a public week-long debate for borderline cases; admins close based on consensus. 
Wikipedia

8. Policies & governance that frame every edit
The entire system is anchored by the three core content policies—Neutral Point of View, Verifiability, and No Original Research—as well as cascading dispute-resolution venues up to the elected Arbitration Committee.

Key Take-aways for designing your own “open-edit but quality-first” platform
Immutable, transparent history enables bold editing without fear.

Graduated trust levels (time + edits) keep the door open while throttling abuse.

Multi-layer review—machine filters, bot reverts, human patrols, formal approval queues—catches problems earlier and cheaper.

Topic-based protection lets you dial security up only where evidence shows it’s needed.

Clear, community-owned policies and public discussion forums foster legitimacy and self-enforcement.

Wikipedia’s model works because the technical features, social norms, and governance structures reinforce one another. Any clone system should plan all three together rather than bolting moderation on as an after-thought.
